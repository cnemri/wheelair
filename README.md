# WheelAir

**WheelAir** is a comprehensive, global database designed to empower wheelchair users and travelers with reduced mobility. By unifying airline policies and international regulations into a single, professional interface, we aim to eliminate the information asymmetry that often makes air travel stressful for the disability community.

## 🚀 The Problem
Airline wheelchair policies are historically difficult to find—often buried in legal fine print, scattered across complex PDFs, or hidden behind inconsistent help centers. For travelers with expensive and essential mobility aids, this lack of clarity leads to anxiety, safety concerns, and potential damage to equipment.
